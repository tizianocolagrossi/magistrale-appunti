# Describe the main objectives of the NIST CyberSecurity Framework and its structure
Trough the CEA (Cybersecurity Enancement Act) the NIST (National Institute for Standards and Tecnology) must
identify a repetable, flexible, cost effective and performance based approach, including security controls 
that can be used by owners of critical infrastructure to identify, manage and respond to cyber risk.

The NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) focuses on using the buisness drivers to guide the cybersecirity
activities and making the cyber risk part of the risk management process.

The CSF final goal is to help organizations that want to introduce some cybersecurity policy into the 
organization from the risk perspective.

This framework (CSF) was developed to improve the cybersecurity risk management of critical infrastructures
and is intended to be used in organization that rely on tecnology such as: IT infrastuctire, IoT, Cyber-phisical
systems or industrial controls.

The main feature of the CSF is that is techology-neutral, in the sense that it does not focus on the specific
technology to protect, but it abstract the tecnology to identify what is the mai problem that can occur in this
context.

**Notice that the framework is not used to compute a risk, but is a tool that the organization uses to address**
**the critical elements that need to be protected and should be considered in the computation of the risk**
**and can also be used to identify the level of risk that the organization can accept.**

The CSF is composed by three parts: CORE, IMPLEMENTATION TIERS and PROFILES.
The **CORE** of the framework provide a set of activities to achive a specific cybersecurity outcome and
address some example that show how to reach it.
It is **composed by 4 elements** that are:
- **Functions**: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover
- **Categories**: contribute the definition of functions and subdivide the functions in group of elements
- **Subcategories**: specoalization of the categories
- **Informative reference**: point to existing standards and best practices that the organization can use to compare

The **IMPLEMENTATION TIERS** take an orthogonal perspective, while in the core we try to identify which are the assets
that we should consider, the implementation tiers provide come criteria to evaluate the security defense of the organization
in term of "maturity of the process" (It check how the organization has structured the process).

It does not say nothing about the quality of the governance put in place by the company
but instead it evaluates how much is structured the process.


The **PROFILES**  is the alignment of the Functions, Categories, and Subcategories with the
business requirements, risk tolerance, and resources of the organization.

They can be used to describe the current state or the desired target state of specific
cybersecurity activities.

- The Current Profile indicates the cybersecurity outcomes that are currently being achieved.
- The Target Profile indicates the outcomes needed to achieve the desiredcybersecurity risk management goals.

The CSF can be used for different reasons, for self-assestment,improve or establish a cybersecurity policy or
for help to chose what an organization should buy (what should buy and what the organization candevelob by itself)

# Describe the structure of the NIST CSF and explain how it can be used to plan investments related to cybersecurity

For the first part seme as abow

For plan investents related to cybersecurity the CSF can be used for:
- improving the cyber seciruty program: so what is the level that the organization want to reach in a specific function
- evaluate what the organization should buy and what can be created by the organization related to the found that the 
  organization has.

So it can be used to plan investments related to the creation or improvement of the security program
of a company and also to decide what the company should buy(as a service from other companies for
example) and what instead we can create inside the company on our own.

#  Discuss the role of Best Practices and Standards in the design and realization of an Information Security Governance system

ISG should help in "doing the right thing in the right way" and every Information Security Manager should be able to 
know how are the right tings and how know that he is doing in a right way.

And in order to doing that he use the best practices. the best practices (or standards) are documents that
include the experience and the solution of other ISM (on which expert have consensus on it) that provides
and internationally accepted framework that can be used as bulding block for ISG.

Example of best practices are NIST or ISO-27k family.

We have seen in particular ISO 27001 and 27002 as examples of best practices.

ISO 27001 is an international standard that defines a set of reqirements to establish, implement, mantain and 
continually improve an ISMS within the context of an organization.

ISO 27002 is and international standards that is intended to be used by organization that want to:
- select controls within the process of implementing and ISMS based on ISO/IEC 27001
- implement common accepted information security management guidelines
- develop their own information security management guidelines

**Each clause defining security controls contains one or more security categories**, where each of them
contains a control objective stating **what is to be achieved and a set of controls that can be applied to
reach this objective**.

The difference between those two standards is in the fact that ISO 27001 is very strict and goes down
in detail, while ISO 27002 is more high-level and provides help to companies that want to build an
ISMS based on the experience of other companies.
