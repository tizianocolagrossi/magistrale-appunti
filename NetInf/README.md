# Introduction

## Types of telecommunication Networks
Alredy known **WAN** **MAN** **LAN** And then we have: 
- **Virtual Private Network** (VPN): A secure network that uses the internet as its main backbone network, but relies on firewall and other security feaures. A **VPN Enabling Technology is IPSec** (SVPN). It is an open architecture for IP- packet encryption and authentication, thus it is located in the **network layer**. IPSec adds  additional headers/trailers to an IP packet and can encapdilate (tunnel) IP packets in new ones.

## Telecommunications media
- Twisted-pair wire
- Coaxial cable
    - minimize interference and distorition
    - allow high-speed data trasmission
- Fiber optics
    - Glass fiber that condict pulses of light generated by lasers
    - Size and weight reduction
    - Increased speed and carring capacity
- Terrestrial Microwave
    - Line-of'sight path between relay stations spaced approximately 40 km apart
- Communication satelites
    - Geosynchronous orbits
    - Serve as relay stations for communications signals transmitted from earth stations
- Cellular Systems
    - Each cell is typically from one to several square miles in area
    - Each cell has its own low-power trasmitter radio rela antenna
    - Computers and other communcations pricessors coordinate and control the trasmission to/from mobile users as they move from one cell to another

## Network functional areas
### access network

Is the part of a communications networks which connects subscribers to their immediate service provider. It may be further divided between feeder plant or distribution network, and drop plant or edge network. **The access network domain plays an important role in a network by connecting communications carriers and service providers with the individuals and companies they serve.

### core network 

Usually are structured in a mesh topology. Provides any-to-any connections among devices in the network. Consist of multiple switches or consist of IP routers. **The internet could be considered a giant core network** (it really consist of many isp that run their own core networks, and those core networks are interconnected). Significant to core networks is *"the edge"*, where networks and user exist.

### edge of the network

The edge may perform intelligent functions that are not performed inside the core network. For example if the core network is usig MPLS (Multiprotocol Label Switching), an edge switch may examine packets and select a path through the network based on various properties of the packet. The core network then switches the packet, instead of doing hop-by-hop, and this improve the performance. (in this case the core network is dumb, wile the edge is smart)


## Distribution network

### Fixed line access network
An access network refers to the series of wires, cables, and equipment lying between a cunsomer/buisness thelephone termination point and the local telephone excange. **The local excange contains banks of automated switching equipment to direct a call or connection to the customer**.

The access network is one of the oldest assets a telecom operator owns, ans is constantly evolving, growning as a new customers are connected, and as new services are offered (this make the access network one of the most complex networks in the world to mantain and keep track of). And **it is the most valuable assets an operators owns** since this is what is phisically allow them to offer a service.

### Local loop 
In telephony the local loop aka subscriber line is the physical link circuit that connects from the demarcation point of the customer premises to the edge of the carrier or telecommunicationsservice provider network. At the edge of the carrier in a traditional PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network) scenario, the local loop terminates in a circuit switch housed in an ILEC Central Office.

Traditionally was wireline fron customer to CO (twisted pair copper) for voice communications. But modern implementation can include a digial loop system in fiber optic cables. **A local loop may be provisioned to support data communication applications, or combined voice and data such as Digital Subscriber Line (DSL).

can be used to carry:
- Analog voice used in traditional **POTS**
- Integrated Service Digital Network (ISDN)
- variant of Digital Subscriber Line (DSL)

Local loop connections include:
- Electric local loop: PLC (power line comm)
- Optical local loop: (Fiber optics services)
- Satellites local loop: (comm satellite and cosmos internet connections)
- Cable optical loop: (Cable modems)
- Wireless local loop (WLL): LMDS (Local Multipoint Distribution Services), GPRS (General Packet Radio Services), HSDPA etc...

### Type of access
#### **Copper cables** 
provides both high-speed broadband and existing phone services. The major advantage of this network is that is wifely avaiable. Existing copper-based network have gradually been expanded dring several decades and their architectures are not optimized with regard to current technologies.

If an entirely new network were to be build today, it would not be based on ue of copper-based techologies. **One problem is that are disigned mainly to carryng POTS** while a growing share of the traffic is based on IP

#### **Optical access**
This domain will be the mode of choice for fixed access in the coming years.

#### **Wireless Access**
This domain enjoys the highest expectation from the standopoint of ubiquitous networking 

# XDSL 
is a family of technologies that provide digital data trasmissions over the wires of a telephone network. DSL stands originally for digital subscriber loop.  

## Asymmetric DSL
Original market driver: distribution of video on demand (VoD) (failed for this target). The distinguishing characteristic of ADSL over other forms of DSL is that the volume of data flow is greater in one direction than the other. Providers usually market ADSL as a service for consumers to connect to the Internet in a relatively
passive mode: able to use the higher speed direction for the "download" from the Internet but not needing to run servers that would require high speed in the other direction.
### Speed
Older ADSL standards can deliver 8 Mbit/s to the customer over about 2 km of unshielded twisted pair copper wire. The latest standard, ADSL2+, can deliver up to
24 Mbit/s, depending on the distance from the central office.

### ADSL frequency bands

ADSL uses two separate frequency bands, referred to as the upstream and downstream bands.
- The upstream band is used for communication from the end user to the telephone central office
- The downstream band is used for communicating from the central office to the end user.
- With standard ADSL, the band from 25.875 kHz to 138 kHz is used for upstream communication, while 138 kHz–1104 kHz is used for downstream communication

### ADSL and cross-talks
Two kinds of cross-talk noise exist: far-end cross-talk (FEXT) and near-end cross-talk (NEXT). Crosstalk typically increases with frequency -> significant impairment for high speed DSL.

#### FEXT
FEXT is the cross-talk between a transmitter and a receiver placed on opposite sides of the cable. FEXT signals travel the entire length of the channel. Since for ADSL “short” cables are used, the signal carried on other pairs, even though coming from far away, are not strongly attenuated and create interferences that affect other pairs. In order to reduce this kind of noise a cable usually doesn't contain more than a dozen twisted pairs.

#### NEXT
NEXT is the cross-talk between a transmitter and a receiver placed on the same side of the cable.
Receiver's signals are softer than transmitter's one, since come from far
away and thus there is a strong interference which reduces quality of useful received data.
NEXT is one of the reason of the frequency division for upstream and downstream in ADSL.

### ADSL: Modulations
- CAP: stands for Carrier-less Amplitude/Phase
modulation, and describes a version of QAM in which
incoming data modulates a single carrier that is then
transmitted down a telephone line. The carrier itself is suppressed before transmission (it contains no information, and can be reconstructed at the receiver), hence the word “carrier-less” (single
carrier but suppressed)
- DMT: (Discrete Multi-Tone)(multicarrier) 
256 sub-bands of 4,3125 kHz each, so
occupying 1.024MHz. Each sub-band is QAM64 modulated for
clean sub-bands, down to QPSK for
noisier lines.

#### **Principle of DMT modulation**
It divide the operational ADSL bandwith into very small subchannells. Discrete carrier or tones are used in the center of each data subchannell. These carriers are used to transmit data indipendently in each subcarrier by means of a specified QAM modulation.

Independent subchannels can be manipulated
individually with consideration of the line conditions, 
If a subchannel is experiencing external interference it
may not be used in favor of other subchannles
**DTM can dynamically adapt the data rate to the line
conditions**
##### **Water filling**
The signal power for each subcarrier is determined as the depth of the
liquid in a pool. Knowing the discreate values of p(fk) for each subcarrier fk one may deduce the number of bit per simbol to associate to the QAM costellation used in each subchannel.

## VDSL Vectoring
Crosstalk cancelling by injecting an “anti-signal”
on each crosstalk-impaired line
- Requires full synchronization over the full vectored system
- All data samples are shared between all the lines
- Requires calculation of the “anti-signals”
- Requires a crosstalk estimating mechanism to derive the crosstalk coefficients

## Point to Point Protocol: summary
PPP was designed for simple links to transport packets between two peers. The ppp encapsulation provides for multiplexing of different network layer protocols simultaneously over the same link. It provides a Link Control Protocol (LCP) which negotiates the establishment and termination of a PPP link. LCP also negotiates the options for encapsulation format, authentication and link quality monitoring.

It is used together with ADSL for its ability to directly
connect the user to the Central Office of its ISP and its
important functions like: authentication, authorization,
automatic configuration of network interfaces and DHCP
support.

In the majority of European countries ADSL is based on
the ATM protocol so PPP is encapsulated inside ATM cells
(PPPoA). Nonetheless ADSL can stand on top of Ethernet and be
incapsulated in Ethernet Frames (PPPoE).

### Authentication
Authentication Option uses Password Authentication Protocol
(PAP) or Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP). The protocol used depends on negotiation. CHAP uses a one-way hashing algorithm which is known only to the
user, to respond to a challenge sent by the authenticator. CHAP is more secure than PAP.
