# Terminology
- **Multiplexer**: Allow a single communication channel to carry simultaneous data trasmission from many terminals.
- **Modem**: Changes signal from analog to digital and back to analog.
- **CO**: central office.
- **LEC**: Local excange carrier.
- **OLT**: Optical line terminal
- **ONU**: Optical network unit
- **ONT**: Optical Network Termination (NT: network termination)
- **ODN**: Optical distribution network
- **AON**: Active Optical Network aka P2P
- **PON**: Passive optical netowork, passive branching of fibes via optical splitters and tree-based topologies
- **Fiber to the excange** : The optical fiber terminates to the CO, and the CO is connected with te user via copper based line (e.g. ADSL)
- **Backhaul:** portion of the network comprises the intermediate links between the core network, or backbone network, and the small subnetworks at the edge of the network. The most common network type in which backhaul is implemented is a mobile network. A backhaul of a mobile network, also referred to as mobile-backhaul connects a cell site towards the core network. The two main methods of mobile backhaul implementations are fiber-based backhaul and wireless point-to-point backhaul.
- **Latency** Is the time of the reaction of the network
- **handoff/Handover**: procedure that keep the connection during the mobility of the user. A base station pass the control of the connection to another one base station.
- **crosstalk** signal that pass from a cable to another. And generAte interference.



# Introduction

## Types of telecommunication Networks
Alredy known **WAN** **MAN** **LAN** And then we have: 
- **Virtual Private Network** (VPN): A secure network that uses the internet as its main backbone network, but relies on firewall and other security feaures. A **VPN Enabling Technology is IPSec** (SVPN). It is an open architecture for IP- packet encryption and authentication, thus it is located in the **network layer**. IPSec adds  additional headers/trailers to an IP packet and can encapdilate (tunnel) IP packets in new ones.

## Telecommunications media
- Twisted-pair wire
- Coaxial cable
    - minimize interference and distorition
    - allow high-speed data trasmission
- Fiber optics
    - Glass fiber that condict pulses of light generated by lasers
    - Size and weight reduction
    - Increased speed and carring capacity
- Terrestrial Microwave
    - Line-of'sight path between relay stations spaced approximately 40 km apart
- Communication satelites
    - Geosynchronous orbits
    - Serve as relay stations for communications signals transmitted from earth stations
- Cellular Systems
    - Each cell is typically from one to several square miles in area
    - Each cell has its own low-power trasmitter radio rela antenna
    - Computers and other communcations pricessors coordinate and control the trasmission to/from mobile users as they move from one cell to another

## Network functional areas
### access network

Is the part of a communications networks which connects subscribers to their immediate service provider. It may be further divided between feeder plant or distribution network, and drop plant or edge network. **The access network domain plays an important role in a network by connecting communications carriers and service providers with the individuals and companies they serve.

### core network 

Usually are structured in a mesh topology. Provides any-to-any connections among devices in the network. Consist of multiple switches or consist of IP routers. **The internet could be considered a giant core network** (it really consist of many isp that run their own core networks, and those core networks are interconnected). Significant to core networks is *"the edge"*, where networks and user exist.

### edge of the network

The edge may perform intelligent functions that are not performed inside the core network. For example if the core network is usig MPLS (Multiprotocol Label Switching), an edge switch may examine packets and select a path through the network based on various properties of the packet. The core network then switches the packet, instead of doing hop-by-hop, and this improve the performance. (in this case the core network is dumb, wile the edge is smart)


## Distribution network

### Fixed line access network
An access network refers to the series of wires, cables, and equipment lying between a cunsomer/buisness thelephone termination point and the local telephone excange. **The local excange contains banks of automated switching equipment to direct a call or connection to the customer**.

The access network is one of the oldest assets a telecom operator owns, ans is constantly evolving, growning as a new customers are connected, and as new services are offered (this make the access network one of the most complex networks in the world to mantain and keep track of). And **it is the most valuable assets an operators owns** since this is what is phisically allow them to offer a service.

### Local loop 
In telephony the local loop aka subscriber line is the physical link circuit that connects from the demarcation point of the customer premises to the edge of the carrier or telecommunicationsservice provider network. At the edge of the carrier in a traditional PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network) scenario, the local loop terminates in a circuit switch housed in an ILEC Central Office.

Traditionally was wireline fron customer to CO (twisted pair copper) for voice communications. But modern implementation can include a digial loop system in fiber optic cables. **A local loop may be provisioned to support data communication applications, or combined voice and data such as Digital Subscriber Line (DSL).

can be used to carry:
- Analog voice used in traditional **POTS**
- Integrated Service Digital Network (ISDN)
- variant of Digital Subscriber Line (DSL)

Local loop connections include:
- Electric local loop: PLC (power line comm)
- Optical local loop: (Fiber optics services)
- Satellites local loop: (comm satellite and cosmos internet connections)
- Cable optical loop: (Cable modems)
- Wireless local loop (WLL): LMDS (Local Multipoint Distribution Services), GPRS (General Packet Radio Services), HSDPA etc...

### Type of access
#### **Copper cables** 
provides both high-speed broadband and existing phone services. The major advantage of this network is that is wifely avaiable. Existing copper-based network have gradually been expanded dring several decades and their architectures are not optimized with regard to current technologies.

If an entirely new network were to be build today, it would not be based on ue of copper-based techologies. **One problem is that are disigned mainly to carryng POTS** while a growing share of the traffic is based on IP

#### **Optical access**
This domain will be the mode of choice for fixed access in the coming years.

#### **Wireless Access**
This domain enjoys the highest expectation from the standopoint of ubiquitous networking
