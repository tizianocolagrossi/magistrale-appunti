# Lecture 03 (CYBER-SECURITY FRAMEWORKS AND BEST PRACTICES)

In USA in 2014, President Obama defines the Cybersecurity Enhancement Act of 2014 (CEA) It updated the role of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to include identifying and developing cybersecurity risk frameworks for voluntary use by critical infrastructure owners and operators

Through CEA, NIST must identify “a prioritized, flexible, repeatable, performance- based, and cost-effective approach, including information security measures and controls that may be voluntarily adopted by owners and operators of critical infrastructure to help them identify, assess, and manage cyber risks”.

## NIST CSF *(national institute standard and tecnology)
The Framework focuses on using business drivers to guide cybersecurity activities and considering cybersecurity risks as part of the organization’s risk managemen processes. It consist in three parts: (Core, Implementation Tiers, Profiles).

NIST CSF was developed to improve cybersecurity risk management in critical infrastructure but it can be used by organizations in any sector or community

It provides a common organizing structure assembling standards,
guidelines, and practices that are working effectively today

It is applicable to organizations relying on technology, whether their
cybersecurity focus is primarily on:
- information technology (IT),
- industrial control systems (ICS)
- cyber-physical systems (CPS)
- connected devices more generally, including the Internet of Things (IoT)

### NIST core
Is a list of action to perform. Presents key cybersecurity outcomes 
identified by Stake-holders as useful in Risk Management.
It comprends:
- **Function**:
  - **Identify** Developing an organizational understanding to manage cybersecurity risks of systems, people, resources, and data
  - **Protect** Develop and implement appropriate safeguards to ensure the delivery of services that are critical services
  - **Detect** Develop and implement appropriate activities to identify the occurrence of a security event
  - **Respond** take action in case of an accident
  - **Recover** maintain resiliency plans and restore any capabilities or services that have been compromised due to an incident.
- **Categories**: subdivision of a function into groups of cybersecurity deliverables closely related to programmatic needs and particular activities.
- **Subcategories**: further subdivision of a category into specific results of technical and/or management activities.
- **Referiments**: Specified sections of standards, guidelines, and common practices across critical infrastructure sectors critical that illustrate a method for achieving the outcomes associated with each subcategory.

The **profile** and alignment of functions, categories, subcategories with the business requirements, tolerance for risk and resources of the organization.

## National Framework
The **National Framework** is a self-assessment tool that allows you to evaluate the current level of security and designate the desired one. It can be customized to fit a specific context.

Is based to the NIST CS Frameworks. The National Framework add two section to the NIST core: the **Priority levels** and the **Maturity levels**, defined for all contextialization. 

The Framework can be adapted to a specific scenario through a Contextualization:
Selection of Subcategories
- Definition of the Priority Level for each selected Subcategory
- Definition of the Maturity Levels of the Controls to reach them

Given a Contextualization, it is possible to define:
- The Current Profile The “as is” state
- A Target Profile The “to be” state

Then with the coming of the NIST CSF 1.1 the National Security Framework created a new version the 2.0 that also includes the GDPR regulations trying to map data protection in a smooth way.

## Comparison between CyberSecurity Frameworks

The **NIST CSF is the main framework**, the most general one then the others develop in a better way with different aspects.

The **ISO 27k** family is a wider collections of document regarding information security used world wide, 

the **FISMA ecosystem** that collects all the documents needed as background for NIST CSF

then **SANS 20 family**, that during the years change names a lot of times: CSC-5 and CIS CSC.

## SP 800-53

Provides a catalog of security and privacy controls for federal organizations and information systems. Provides a process for selecting controls to protect.

## ISO/IEC 27K vs NIST SP 800-53

The 800-53 has an appendix that provides the mapping between the controls of the two standards. All FISMA standards are system-oriented, while the ISOs are dedicated to the organization.
