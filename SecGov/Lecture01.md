# Lecture 01 (introduction)

Context in which we will work: Enterprise. It has a mission (prudicon some goods or some services etc). The Entrprise is composed by many people in order to accomplish the mission (process). This people interact with an ICT infrastructure (cyber part of the enterprise). There are then the processes, and relationship betwen people (manager, responsible etc). This relationship affect the processes and their delivery.

In this complex ecosystem we want to learn how put in place a security governance environment.

## What is the concept of governance
> “Governance is all of the processes of governing, whether undertaken by a government, a market or a network, over a social system (family, tribe, formal or informal organization, a territory or across territories) and whether through the laws, norms, power or language of an organized society" (Mark Bevir)

> “The Governance is the processes of interaction and decision-making among the actors involved in a collective problem that lead to the creation, reinforcement, or reproduction of social norms and institutions” (Marc Hufty)

The keyword are **processes** and **norms**. So when we talk about governance we are talking about the definition of processes (procedurs policies etc) that should be put in place in company in compliance with norms and regulation.

Exist different type of governance (because is a high concept). Inside the company the firs type of governance that we must take account is the *Enterprise Governance*.

The enterprise of governance is simply the set of processes that allow to govern the enterprise. So we need to be compiant with the regulation of our sector, market.

> “Enterprise governance is the structure and relationships that ***control***, ***direct***, or regulate the performance of an enterprise [and its] projects, portfolios, infrastructure, and processes” 

**Control** and **Direct** are the core processes behind any governance system. In the securty governance *direct* and *control* put in place a feedback loop that we need to sustain in order to gain the maximum from our security enviroinment.

Into the enterprise governance we have multiple processes that are of different type, so we can subdivide the notion Enterprise governance in:
-   buisness governance
-   corporate governance

**Buisness Governance** is the set of procedures (policies) that we put in place to suatain our buisness (Performance Processes), so processes to put in place our production.

**Corporate Governance** is the set of processes put in place to control and support the buisness (Process for control the mantainance of the suppoly chain, not belong to the buisness part but is complementar and mus be put in place).

We are more interested in the coropate governance. As in a company the relationship are subdividen in a piramid scheme we can also decompose our corporate governance direct/control loop in a piramidal scheme.

At **directive level (strategic level)** we have the definition of what the company shoul do (the objectives) with respect to the buisness and with respect to te supporting part (compliance) **here ehat what we need to do is identify the goods (identify the objective and code into the directives)**.

In the **intermediate level (Tactical level)** is still composed by management profiles but here the focus is on how things should be done, so they takes the macro objective setted by the Strategic level and they traslate it into more plactical objectives identifyng which are the set of policies and which are the set of standards that we need to satisfy. Once this is done we can ghive the input to the operational people.

In the **bottom level (Operational level)** we have the people that do the things in practice. 

So **moving from top to bottom** we can design what is called the direct process (we start settings up the objective, we traslate it into policies and finally into procedure) so from top to bottom we design how we should do the things. 

At the bottom we do the things so we execute practically the procedure identified and we **start to check if the procedure does whiat is supposed to do**.

And **moving bottom to up** whit the contol process we check if the objective indentified in our level are satisfied in some way, and we pass the report to the upper level, if the objective are not reached the company can modiy things and starting another loop.

This is the basic stricture of any governance system.

So in an enterprise we are trying to put in place this loop in this complex environment. The final objective is **taking care of threats and vulerability that can arise in the company (bugs error backdoors etc)**. We can have vulnerability in all the section of the enterprise: network, process, relation between people (password over posit on the monitor), safe place etc.

## Corporate Governance and Risk management

The Direct/Control loop is driven by Risks. The IT Governance Institute redefine the concept of Enterprise (and thus Corporate) 
Governance as follow:

>“Enterprise governance is a set of responsibilities and practices exercised by the board  and executive management with the goal of providing strategic direction, ensuring that  objectives are achieved, ascertaining that risks are managed appropriately and  verifying that the enterprise’s resources are used responsibly.”

So objective (Direct): risk reduction , objective (Control): measure risk reduction.

## Enterprise Governance Decomposition

Corporate governance and Buisness governance are not the final decomposition but we can decompose again the governance.

IN this course we eill focus on the IT part because we are talking about *cyber security*.

When we talk about governance we talk about risk and in particular risk related to the server space, so the electronic asset that support the buisness processes. So in particular:
- data and information stored locally
- data and information trasmitted over the network
- All the systems and application that we use in order to support the system

So **data, network, and application used to support processes**. In order to do that we eill use the security properties of the electronic assets: (confidentiality, integrity, avaiability).

How can we compute the risk. What does this means compute the risk at IT level. It means that we have a systems, communiacton network with data moving between hosts, data stored some were etc. When we will compute the risk it means that we need to identify what is important for the company so which are the electronic assets (sometimes this is not eady because the company does not know what is really an asset for him). So we need to identify which are the assets and the potential attacks that are of interest to the assets and then make an evaluation. In doing that we need to consider the external attacker but also the internal attacker.

## Definition of security governance
 Securoty governance is simply the composition of the governance (direct/control) over the security perspective. So we need to apply the direct and control loop in order to identify the security processes of the company. Where for us the security refers mainly to the cybersecurity.

## Practically what should I do?

Answer to these question helps in understanding the right level of formalisation:
- How large and complex is your organisation?
- What resources are available for security governance?
- What does your organisation do and how important is security to those aims?
- Are there any external considerations (for example contractual, legal, regulatory or 
sector specific requirements)?

In practical terms, the correct approach means identifying:
-   the security decisions that need to be made
-   the people who will make them
-   the information required to make sensible and informed choices

Positioning of Security Governance. Security is precess, people, relationship between people and netowrk infrastructures.
